//Create a new class called character and make a character manager. (the character should initially behave like the ball class from previous lecture).
//Create a Human class that extends from the character class.
//Create a Zombie class that inherits from character, but they are slower (and green).
//Let the character manager spawn 99 humans and 1 Zombie.
//Let the manager check if a Zombie "collies" with a human. If they collide, replace the Human with a new Zombie.
//(there are several reasons for not doing it this way, more on that later).
//When a human (or zombie) gets to the edge, they do not bounce like the balls, instead they screen warp to the other side.
//When all humans are (un)dead print GAME OVER on the screen and how long it took before all died (time since the program started).
